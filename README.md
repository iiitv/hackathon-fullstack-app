Android app for **What The Feed**

> What The Feed is a social media aggregration platform that helps you follow related social media accounts at once. Suppose you are interested in some topic, say "Indian Finance", WTF will automatically find the leading social media accounts for that topic, follow their posts and provide you with an aggregrated feed. These topics are called "subscriptions" and you can subscribe to as many topics as you want.

You can find the backend's source at https://github.com/iiitv/hackathon-fullstack-server
